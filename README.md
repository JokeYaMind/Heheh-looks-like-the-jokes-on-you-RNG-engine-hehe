the  Juggalo Time Loom (Heheh... Looks like the joke's on you)
"Time is a flat circle? No. Time is a Slinky in a magnetic field."

⚠️ THE RULES
NO SLAVES: This code is Copyleft. It belongs to the dirt. No one owns the math.
NO TIME: There is no clock (t). Time emerges from the tension. If the ratchet doesn't click, time doesn't happen.
NO OBSERVER: The system doesn't need you to watch it. It grows weeds on its own.
🧬 THE ANIS GENETICS (Sources & Ingredients)
This engine was cooked up using:

RNG (Raw Time): The chaos before the order.
Quarks: The directional aids (Up/Down/Strange/Charm) that steer the chaos.
Living Soil: A chemical buffer of pH, Density, and Moisture that absorbs the "failed" moments.
Diamond Memory: The "snaps" where tension got too high and reality crystallized.
